# Zombie-texture-replacement
This mod replaces all the regular zombie textures with improved ones.

To install this very complex mod, you'll need high understanding and skill on the use of regular keyboards and mouse.

Just copy the contents inside the 7DaysToDie_Data folder and paste them in C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\7 Days To Die\Data\7DaysToDie_Data

Yes, replace all.

Yes, it's done. Go kill some zombies now.
